            <Description>
                I am a third-year student at Abdullah GÃ¼l University in Turkey, currently studying Computer Engineering. 
                I'm interested in backend services with <p className="underlined-stack">Python</p> and I have some experience 
                in the fields of mobile and web development. Indeed, I'm very open to discovering different fields. 
                Even though I don't have much experience, I'm interested in DevOps tools 
                such as <p className="underlined-stack">Docker</p> and <p className="underlined-stack">Kubernetes</p>.
